In this chapter there will be taken a closer look on the theoretical aspect of writing a sorting program. First off is a quick description the NP-problem followed by a look on different ways to pack different objects.
With a good grasp on the different algorithms and the most effective way to pack items, the process of developing a program should be easier.
