\section{Program planing}
This section is to plan how the program should work and describe the flow of the program. The program will be described in a flowchart to give an overview of the whole program. A flowchart is an useful tool when programming because it explains the structure of the program.

To give a more precise explanation of a program the flowchart can be formed into a pseudocode which is a level above real code. Pseudocode is used as a schematic for the program and thereby giving some foresight into any problems that can be encountered when writing the actual code. Thus planing ahead and designing the program so a minimum amount of code errors and unexpected problems appears.
The program planing will be used to make it easier to develop the program and help to a better product in terms of structure.

When the program starts, it should first ask for the bags dimensions. The user then have to decide whether to use a pre made list, reuse a list from earlier use or create a new list containing objects that should be packed. If the user decide to a make new list the program will ask the user for items that should be stored in the new list. Should the new list be empty the program will inform the user that the list that were just made is empty and ask if the user still wished to saved it in the database.
If the user chooses to use a pre made settings the program will fetched the list from the database and if ask if these items are what the user is looking for.

The program shall then preform the algorithms to place the items in the most efficient way regarding volume and weight. When the program succeed to place an item, the item will be marked as packed. If the program can not fit the items in any of the accessible bags the items should be marked as not packable. If the program reach the point where all items have been packed it should inform the user that the process was a success and how the user have to pack the bags. If the program does not complete the process and there are no bags left, the program should inform the user that process was incomplete. Then the program should be at the end where the user can choose to add more items, see the exiting item, see the order of packing and close the program.

Thereby the general structure of the program have been formed and can be describe by a flowchart, see on figure: \ref{fig:flow}.
This flowchart can then be used as a schematic for the developing of the program and thereby a better structure of the program can be archived.
