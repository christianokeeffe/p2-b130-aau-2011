\section{The Development of The Packing Algorithm}
\label{sec:devalgorithm}
The algorithm was developed from the theory described in section \ref{sec:algorithm}. The theory has been extended from the experiences when packing the program. These extensions have made the packing more effective, which result in that more items can be packed.
