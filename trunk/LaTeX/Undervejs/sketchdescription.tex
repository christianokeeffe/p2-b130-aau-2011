\subsubsection{Sketch}

Designing the program required some sketches and our first sketch looked like this:
It shows some boxes where the user must type the dimensions of the suitcase, so the program knows how much space it has to deal with, and the measurement is the metric unit system.
When the user has typed the dimensions the program will calculate and make 3D image of the suitcase,

It has been discussed whether if there should be a 3D image or a 2D image of the suitcase where the user can see where the items shall be placed. In the beginning it became clear that it was not a good idea to talk about 3D images in the program because it was not certain that Visual Studio could handle 3D images, and at last it was concluded that the program will show a 3D image of how the packing should be done when the user has pressed the "Start Packing"-button.

On the sketch below we looked at how the packing list should look like, and what functions it will contain.

At last we managed how the GUI will look like. We replaced the 3D image viewer with the list of added items because it was
