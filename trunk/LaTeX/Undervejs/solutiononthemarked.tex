The amount of lists and guides on the market is huge. These lists and guides offers help and provide tips for packing for travelling. Some of these lists and guides have been developed into apps(application) that are available for the customer to use.

On their website %\citep{} 
they offer a demo(demonstration) of their program.

\subsection{Solutions coverages of the requirements}

In this section there will be look into what the different existing programs features and compare them to the requirements that have been set to solve the given problem. The comparison will be in the from of a table that gives a overview of the coverage of the requirements. The table will be used to conclude if there already are a program that solves this problem.

\label{tab:OtherPrograms}
\end{table}

On table: \ref{tab:OtherPrograms} it can be conclude that none of the found program fully covers the requirements set to solve the problem at hand.
Thereby it can be conclude it is relevant to work with this problem at hand and try to solve it.
