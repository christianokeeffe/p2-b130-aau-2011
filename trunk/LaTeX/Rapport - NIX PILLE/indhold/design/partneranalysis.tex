\section{Partner Analysis}
This section is an analysis about who and what kind of groups could use a product such as the one this project is aiming to make.
Instead of a specific target group this analysis will focus on cases in which someone might need this product.
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{People who have problems packing a suitcase properly:}\newline
If someone do not know how to effectively pack their own suitcase, be it how to distribute the weight of the items or how to utilize the space.

\item \textbf{Families or groups of people who share or do not mind sharing suitcases when going on a trip together:}\newline
When traveling in a group there is an opportunity to share space amongst each other. A program that can calculate this would be ideal to better utilize this increase in bags and thereby an increase in bag space. 
\end{itemize}

Based on this analysis the general functions and design of the product is created to fit the cases described best. This will be described in greater detail in section \ref{sec:sketches}.
