This section will describe the tests, the results from the tests and the improvement on the program which came from the results of the tests. To help ensure that the program does not have any obvious bugs, test were performed on the program which helps find those bugs. Therefore it is better that a person who is not a part of the project group is going to be the one testing it. If it is a person from the group who is testing, he or she might not find a bug or problem with the program, because he/she is already used to the program.
