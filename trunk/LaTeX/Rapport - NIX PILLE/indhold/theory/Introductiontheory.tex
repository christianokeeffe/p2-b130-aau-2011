In this chapter a closer look will be taken on the theoretical aspect of writing a sorting program.
With a good grasp on the different algorithms and the most effective way to pack items, the process of developing a program should be easier. A famous packing problem is the Knapsack problem, which is described in detail in section \ref{sec:knapsack}. A derivative of the Knapsack problem is the bin packing problem, which is described in section \ref{sec:binpacking}.
