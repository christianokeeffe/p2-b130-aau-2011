This report contains documentation of which problems some people might have packing their suitcases before travel. These chapters will lead up to a statement of the problem which will be used in the development of a solution.


The solution will be a program based on the programming language C\#. There will be a chapter describing how the structure of the program will be, and the reason behind the construction. There will also be a section about the reflections, when the program was being made.


One of the last chapters will concern the testing and conclusion of the finished program. Through these tests, it was discovered what should be corrected in the program. This chapter will also concern the reflections on the product to see if it actually solves the problem or why it does not solve the problem.


The product of the project is a program that helps the user pack a suitcase efficiently, and through a 3D-image of the packed suitcases the user will see where in the suitcase each item must be put.
