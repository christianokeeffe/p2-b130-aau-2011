This project has been made by Rasmus Fischer Gadensgaard, Christian Jødal O'Keeffe, Casper Plejdrup, Aleksander Sørensen Nilsson, Niels Brøndum Pedersen, Mette Thomsen Pedersen and Dag Toft Børresen Pedersen from Denmark. We are group B205. The project began on 14.10.2011 and was finished on the 20.12.2011, at the University of Aalborg, and were we are studying Software.

Most of us come from Tech College Aalborg, but some come from other colleges. We all chose University of Aalborg because we like the PBL model. PBL stands for Problem Based Learning and it is a unique learning method that is only used at University of Aalborg and Roskilde University Centre (RUC).

The goal of this project is to make us better programmers with the programming language C and make us better at working in groups of 5 to 7 people. The project is about passport photos and our main questions are: Why are so many passport photos being discarded and what can be done about it?
