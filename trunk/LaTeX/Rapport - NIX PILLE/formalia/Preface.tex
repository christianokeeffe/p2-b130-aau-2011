This project is based on the subject "image editing" with a focus on passport photos. From this project a product should emerge that will try and deal with a problem within the subject's field. When the product is done, it should be tested and based on the test it will be possible to evaluate the product's capability at solving the problem.
\newline
It is a requirement that the program is made in the program language C. The program will therefore be a command line based program.\newline
A part of the project is to document a problem and analyse it, to find the reason behind the problem. When the analysis is done, the product should be designed to handle the problem and thus solve it.
\newline
This is the essential of problem-based learning: to find a problem and then solve it and hopefully gaining some knowledge in the process.
For this to be an effective model all the group members must participate in the process and acquire knowledge by working with the project.
