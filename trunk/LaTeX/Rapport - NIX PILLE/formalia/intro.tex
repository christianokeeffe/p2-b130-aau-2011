This project is based on the subject "Pak kufferten" (Pack the Suitcase) seen on Appendix \ref{chap:forslag} with a focus on helping users to pack a suitcase properly. From this project a product should emerge that will deal with a problem within the subject's field. When the product is done it should be tested. Based on the test it will be possible to evaluate the product's capability at solving the problem.

It is a requirement that the program is made in the programing language C\#. It is not a requirement that the program has a graphical user interface (GUI), but it is an option.
A part of the project is to document a problem and analyze it, to find the reason behind the problem. When the analysis is done, the product should be designed to handle the problem and thus solve it.

This is the essential of problem-based learning: To find a problem, then work on a solution, and hopefully gain some knowledge in the process.
For this to be an effective model all of the group members must participate in the process and acquire knowledge by working with the project.

This project was in the project catalog, which can seen in appendix \ref{chap:forslag}. The catalog was made by the semester coordinator, Hans HÃ¼ttel, and this project was chosen based on the expectations in the group.
