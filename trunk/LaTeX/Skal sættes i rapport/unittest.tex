\section{Unit Tests}
\label{sec:unittests}
Unit tests are used to test specific parts of the code in a program. It is very important because overlooked bugs can be spotted more easily. In this project, unit tests were only used in a limited extend, because it was taught very late in the object oriented programming course. Unit tests were applied to the frmMain form in the program, and they only test methods regarding the managing of suitcases. The unit tests helped removed minor bugs in the handling of the suitcases.
