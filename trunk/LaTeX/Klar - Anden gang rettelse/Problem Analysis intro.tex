This project is based on the idea that it can be hard for some people to pack a suitcase properly. It can also be hard to take in account that the suitcase must not exceed the maximum weight limit of some types of trips, and some people might get fined for packing a suitcase to heavily. What can be done to make it easier for people to pack their suitcases? To find the answer to this, and to find a solution to this problem, it is necessary to take a closer look at the "Why there is a maximum weight on suitcases when one is traveling"-question.
