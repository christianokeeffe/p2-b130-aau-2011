\section{Decision Making}
In this project we continued to use the same form as the last project. No group member is allowed to make a project related decision on its own, we as a group had to come to an agreement first. In this regard we decided that at least five group members should be present when a major decision should be made. Concerning the project it was very important that everyone knew which direction it was headed and what they wanted out of it.

When a decision was needed we held a meeting to which we appointed an agenda manager to keep it structured and civil so it was possible to hold a conversation and come to an agreement.
We still believe this is the best way to handle decision making, so we have continued this style from the last project.
