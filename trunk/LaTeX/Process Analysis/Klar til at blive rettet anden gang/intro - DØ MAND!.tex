\chapter{Introduction}
The process analysis is an analysis where we reflect on the project. The analysis describes how the group have worked during the semester. In the process analysis, it will also be described what went well and what can be changed for the next project. The process analysis will be used to figure out what was done, and what to take with us in the next project.
