\section{Summery of Group Meetings}
Summaries are made at the meetings if needed. The summaries are made by the reporter who then saves them for later so everyone in the group have a chance of reading them. 
The summaries are made from the agenda list and mostly consists of keywords or short lines explaining what was talked about at the meeting.
It is a very good idea to write summaries at the meetings since whats needs to be done in the following week will be saved where everybody in the group can read it. 
Another good thing is that if a group member is missing from a meeting  that person will be able to read what happened in the meeting afterwards and therefore still keep up about what is happening in the group.
