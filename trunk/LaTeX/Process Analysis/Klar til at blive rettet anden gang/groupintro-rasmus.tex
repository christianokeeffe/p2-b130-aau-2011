Our group work for this semesters project was really good just as the last project we had a high work moral and we worked from 09:10 to 16:15. We worked so well and hard that we decided that it was okay to leave at 14:00 if we so desired. During to changes in the planning we did not meet our timeschedule, so our group coordinator decided that we had to work to 16:15 again, and you should have a good reason if you wanted to leave before that. 
Just like last project we had our weekends free to do what we pleased and that also helped keep our moral as high as it was.

All in all our group work were very high and everyone did their part to get our project done in time. 
This chapter will be a more detailed look at our group work for this semester to get a better understanding on what we did and what might be done better.
