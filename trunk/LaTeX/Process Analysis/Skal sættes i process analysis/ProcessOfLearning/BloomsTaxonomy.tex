\section{Blooms Taxonomy}
Bloom's taxonomy is a way to measure how good one's learning skill is, with 6 abstraction levels.
By using Bloom's taxonomy we can see what level we have reached. The conclusion was that we made it up to the 6th level, because we could evaluate this project and see what our profit was, what has been forgotten, and what we could have done better. It can be seen in the project that we have analyzed, understood, and evaluated the problem and found a possible solution to the problem. The evaluation and conclusion on the process can be seen in the conclusion chapter in the project report.
