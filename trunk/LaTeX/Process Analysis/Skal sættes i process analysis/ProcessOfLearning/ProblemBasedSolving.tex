\section{Problem Based Solving}
\label{PBS}
The problem based solving method is used for two reasons. Firstly it is the standard work method on the University of Aalborg and secondly it is an efficient method for learning.
This working method is also fitted for group work, because the group will have to work together and find a solution to a problem.

When working with a problem you gain experience looking into a problem, understanding the problem and through the understanding find a solution if it exists. A very important part is also to document the problem before actually try to solve the problem.
These experiences can be used in the projects to come.

So we still find the problem based learning the most effective and attractive way of learning when working in a group.
