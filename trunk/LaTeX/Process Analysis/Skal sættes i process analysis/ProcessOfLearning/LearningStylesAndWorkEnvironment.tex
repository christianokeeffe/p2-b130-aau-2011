\section{Learning Styles and the Work Environment}
Working environment is a very important part of the group work because it can harm the working process. Therefore we have decided to have lunch in the middle of the day. This is to ensure that members of the group get something to eat and to have a break to have casual conversations with other members.

Since the group room is rather small, the window is open most of the time to ventilate the room and to get some fresh air. We experienced from the last project that a closed room with bad ventilation can cause members to loose their concentration and therefore we have chosen to ventilate more on a daily basis.

In the last project we also experienced that a casual environment is important. The group has chosen to keep the water heater, the refrigerator and the microwave from the last project because it made it possible for members to make tea and reheat food. During this project, we have also acquired a coffee machine and an oven. This has a positive effect on the work environment.

The group also kept the deal with all members attending the lectures and the group work afterwards. If there are no lectures we meet and work on the project instead.
If a group member is not able to attend he/she should have a reason that should be given to the other members.
