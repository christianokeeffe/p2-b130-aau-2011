\section{Summery of Group Meetings}
Summaries are made at the meetings and are made by the reporter who then saves them for later so everyone in the group has a chance for reading them. 
The summaries are made from the agenda list and mostly consists of keywords or short lines explaining what was talked about at the meeting.
It is a very good idea to write summaries at the meetings since everything that needs to be done in the following week will be saved. 
Another good thing is that if a group member is missing from a meeting that person will be able to read what happened in the meeting afterwards and therefore still keep up about what is happening in the group.
