\section{Decision Making}
In this project we continued to use the same form as the last project. No one person can make a project related decision on their own, we as a group had to come to an agreement first. In this regard we decided that atleast five group members should be present when a major decision should be made. Concerning the project it was very important that everyone knew which direction it was headed and what they wanted out of it.
To this end we held a meeting to which we appointed an agenda manager to keep it structured and civil so it was possible to hold a conversation and really get something out it.
We still believe this is the best way to handle decision making, so we have continued this style from the last project.
