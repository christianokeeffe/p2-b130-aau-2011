\chapter{Conclusion}
We think that the whole project has gone very well. We have used the group coordinator and time schedule as magnificent tools for controlling our project, and keeping us on the right track in terms of the deadline. When the group coordinator noticed that we were behind schedule, he suspended the rule about working at from 14 o' clock, which turned out to help greatly on our progress. We have not needed the Conflict Emergency Team, as there has not been any conflicts in the group, but we think it is important to keep the Conflict Emergency Team, should a conflict arise. We will also keep the other roles, for example the Agenda Manager, who makes it easier to have meetings. 

This project is bases on problem based learning, which means working with a problem, and trying to develop a solution to the problem. This has helped us understand the context of the problem on a deeper level. We made a partner analysis, to help us aim our solution to the problem at specific types of persons. Every member of the group have been an active part of the work in this project, which means that every group member have been a part of the project. Throughout the project, we have gathered new knowledge on the subject of packing a suitcase. We are already experienced in working together, as we were also working together in the first semester. But still we have developed our skills at working together as a group.
