\section{Learning Styles and the Work Environment}
The work environment plays an important roll because it can effect the work process itself. Therefore we, in the group, have decided to have a lunch break at the middle of the day. This is to ensure that members of the group gets something to eat and a break to talk with other members or other activities.

Because the group room is rather small, the window is open must of the time to ventilate the room and get some fresh air. We learned from the last project that a closed room with bad ventilation can cause members to loose their concentration and therefore we have chosen to ventilate more on a daily basis.

As we also learned from the last project that home articles are important for the environment. The group have chosen to keep the coffee machine, water heater and microwave because the made it possible for members to make coffee, tea or heat food which is pretty neat. This has a positive effect on the work environment.

The group also kept the deal with all members attends the lectures and the group work afterwards. If there is no lectures we meet and work on the project itself.
If a group were not able to meet they should have a reason that should be messaged to the other members.
