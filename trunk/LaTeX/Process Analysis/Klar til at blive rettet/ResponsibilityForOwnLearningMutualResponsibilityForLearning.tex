\section{Responsibility for Own Learning/Mutual Responsibility for Learning}
In this group, we think that the lectures are very important. There it is stated in the group contract (see \fxfatal{ref til gruppekontrakt}), that each member of this group must be present at all lectures. Because Aalborg University bases its project on group work, we think that each group member has a responsibility for each others learning. If one group member has trouble understanding something in a lecture, the other group members is responsible for helping that particular member to understand.
