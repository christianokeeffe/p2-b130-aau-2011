When you are going on a trip and have to stay out for one or more nights you normally need to pack some luggage. The way people pack their luggage is not always the same. Some just throw their items randomly into the suitcase, while others put it nicely into to suitcase but without a specific order. And others again have a system regarding which order the items are put into the suitcase. But not having a good system in packing sometimes result in the weight being unevenly spread and there might be a lot of wasted space in the suitcase so you have to pack more bags than strictly needed. And finding ones things in a big filled suitcase can require a long search.
