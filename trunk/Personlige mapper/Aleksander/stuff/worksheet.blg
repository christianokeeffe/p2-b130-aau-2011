This is BibTeX, Version 0.99dThe top-level auxiliary file: worksheet.aux
I couldn't open style file bibtex/harvard.bst
---line 3 of file worksheet.aux
 : \bibstyle{bibtex/harvard
 :                         }
I'm skipping whatever remains of this command
I found no style file---while reading file worksheet.aux
(There were 2 error messages)
