The first stage of the project is the problem analysis, which purpose is to find and document a that there are a problem to begin with. From the problem analysis a thesis statement are formed and are used to produce a list of product requirements.
The requirements are then use to design and develop a product that should solve the problem stated in the thesis statement.
The program are then tested on the targeted group that was found affected by the problem. The testing leads to a conclusion of the project. This main course of the project work when using the Aalborg PBL.
