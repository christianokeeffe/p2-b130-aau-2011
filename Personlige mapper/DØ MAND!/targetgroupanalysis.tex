\subsection{Target Group Analysis}
The target group analysis for this project will be made through the Minerva Model, because it is an internationally recognized model, and it suits the international market better than e.g. the Gallup Compass.

The Minerva model consist of 4 main segments; The Blue, the Green, the pink, and the violet:
\begin{itemize}
\item[The Blue segment]
These people belong to the modern and materialistic culture. They are individualists who mostly believe in themselves and are rarely solider with certain groups, but they gladly join other people who are going the same way as they are. The crucial key for the modern materialist's group is that they consider society as a relatively fair and justified system which rewards the one who does an effort that can be felt in society.

The blue segment mostly consists of men with a long education and a high wage. They definitely know where The Danish Liberal Party (Venstre) is, meaning that the party sticks to the values that have been set when the party was established. It is estimated that 25\% of the Danish population belongs in the blue segment.

\item[The Green segment]
The green segment consists of modern, but idealistic, and strongly solider people who have the same kind of education as themselves. They often consider society as something that is "higher" than the group they belong to, and they consider everything outside their own group with some scepticism. Depending on the conjunctures they seem to have some tendency to feel either better than society or besieged.

Mostly women, academics, and similar. Read "Information" or "Politiken", two left oriented newspapers. Vote for The Danish Socialistic Folk Party (Socialistisk Folkeparti), The Danish Red-Green Party (Enhedslisten), The Danish Radical Left Party (Det Radikale Venstre), and they are courted by The Danish Social Democrats (Socialdemokraterne).
It is estimated that 25\% of the Danish population belongs in the green segment.

\item[The Pink segment]
This culture is traditional-idealistic, and is, in many ways, the most "original". Here you are for-anchored in local areas and feel a strong solidarity with everyone in the neighbourhood. Within this culture, one's view upon charity for close friends and family should be taken literal, and the world around them become more and more frightening the further you move away from it.

The people in this group tend to be uneducated, or at least having a short education. Some of them have an allotment garden, and other Danish valuable stuff which they took great care of. They have earlier voted for The Danish Social Democrats, but now it is The Danish Folk Party (Dansk Folkeparti) that is the most favourable  party.

It is estimated that 20\% of the population belongs in the pink segment.

\item[The Violet segment]

\end{itemize}
