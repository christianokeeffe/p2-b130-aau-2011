\subsection{Target Group Analysis}
The target group analysis for this project will be made through the Minerva Model, because it is an internationally recognized model, and it suits the international market better than e.g. the Gallup Compass.

The Minerva model consist of 4 main segments, and 1 sub segment; The Blue, the Green, the pink, the violet, and the grey:
\begin{itemize}
\item[The Blue segment]
These people belong to the modern and materialistic culture. They are individualists who mostly believe in themselves and are rarely solider with certain groups, but they gladly join other people who are going the same way as they are. The crucial key for the modern materialist's group is that they consider society as a relatively fair and justified system which rewards the one who does an effort that can be felt in society.

The blue segment mostly consists of men with a long education and a high wage. They definitely know where The Danish Liberal Party (Venstre) is, meaning that the party sticks to the values that have been set when the party was established. It is estimated that 25\% of the Danish population belongs in the blue segment.

\item[The Green segment]
The green segment consists of modern, but idealistic, and strongly solider people who have the same kind of education as themselves. They often consider society as something that is "higher" than the group they belong to, and they consider everything outside their own group with some scepticism. Depending on the conjunctures they seem to have some tendency to feel either better than society or besieged.

Mostly women, academics, and similar. Read "Information" or "Politiken", two left oriented newspapers. Vote for The Danish Socialistic Folk Party (Socialistisk Folkeparti), The Danish Red-Green Party (Enhedslisten), The Danish Radical Left Party (Det Radikale Venstre), and they are courted by The Danish Social Democrats (Socialdemokraterne).
It is estimated that 25\% of the Danish population belongs in the green segment.

\item[The Pink segment]
This culture is traditional-idealistic, and is, in many ways, the most "original". Here you are for-anchored in local areas and feel a strong solidarity with everyone in the neighbourhood. Within this culture, one's view upon charity for close friends and family should be taken literal, and the world around them become more and more frightening the further you move away from it.

The people in this group tend to be uneducated, or at least having a short education. Some of them have an allotment garden, and other Danish valuable stuff which they took great care of. They have earlier voted for The Danish Social Democrats, but now it is The Danish Folk Party (Dansk Folkeparti) that is the most favourable  party.

It is estimated that 20\% of the population belongs in the pink segment.

\item[The Violet segment]
Violet people are traditional and materialistic. They have a lot of the same norms as the pink segment, but have lost their roots, which is why it often seems to miss some orienting points in life, both in the relation to the group and in relation to society. As a compensation seeks the violet person exile in consumption, and modern offers about group affiliation such as associations, hobbies, sports clubs, fan clubs etc. 

The violet have, as the pink, lost group affiliation to the working party and are now those who can't decide whether to vote The Conservative or The Danish Folk Party, but they definitely have their favourite football club. They frequently seek physical challenges rather than intellectual, and work for spare time.

It is estimated that 20\% of the population belongs to the violet segment.

\item[The Grey Segment]
The grey does not appear in A.C. Nielsen's official model and are the most discussed individuals. It is the people who haven't decided which segment they belong to yet. It's typically the youth, but some adults haven't found themselves in a specific segment. The grey segment is 10-11\% of the population above the age of 18.

The grey can be found in the middle of coordinate system and contains features from all the "pure" segments.

Our target group is in the modern segments because we've calculated that our users are somewhat interested in new technologies, and so we figured that there is a chance of finding somebody in this segment who don't know how to properly pack a suitcase. But the targeted group can't be put into just one segment because there are people from both the blue, the green, and the grey segments. It's a quite wide group, but we think it's necessary to say that our product aren't suitable for one segment only.
