\section{Bin Packing Complexity}
The Bin Packing Problem is NP-hard \ref{combopt}. This means that the problem is at least as hard as an existing NP-complete problem. NP-complete means simplified that every combination must be examined, and then the best combination must be chosen. An example is the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP), where a list of cities and distances between the cities is given. The problem is then to find the shortest route to visit all cities, and to end at the starting point.
