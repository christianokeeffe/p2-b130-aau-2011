\section{Bin packing problem}
\label{sec:binpacking}
Bin packing problems is a combinatorial NP-hard problem. The problem consists of fitting objects of different sizes into bins of identical sizes \ref{appofdismath}. This could for example be fitting various packages into shipping containers. There are various approaches to solve the bin packing problem. Bin packing problem is focusing on bins instead of suitcases but they are basically the same, the only difference is probably the size. Some of the popular methods will be described in the following section. To describe these packing algorithms, illustrations will be used. The illustrations shows how the packing algorithms works in one dimension - but it gives a nice basic understanding of the algorithms. Figure \ref{bpini} is an illustration of the unpacked elements:

Given below are examples of different fitting methods used when packing bins.

\subsection{First fit (FF)}
The first fit algorithm creates a list of the objects needed to be fitted into bins. It then runs through the list, checking if an item can fit in each bin. If it cannot fit in the first bin, it will check if it can fit in the second bin and so on. If it does not fit in any bins, it opens a new bin, and fits the object there. Figure \ref{bpff} is an illustration of the elements packed with the First fit algorithm.

\subsection{Best fit (BF)}
The best fit algorithm is much the same as the first fit algorithm, except it does not fit the object into the first bin that can contain it, the algorithm compares it to each open bin, where the object fit. It will then place the object in the bin which will have the least space left when the object is packed. Figure \ref{bpbf} is an illustration of the elements packed with the Best fit algorithm.

\subsection{Last fit (LF)}
This algorithm packs the object in the last open bin which has room for it. This algorithm is thereby the opposite of the first fit algorithm. Figure \ref{bplf} is an illustration of the elements packed with the Last fit algorithm.

\subsection{Worst fit (WF)}
The algorithm checks all the bins, and packs the object in the bin which has most empty space. As its name suggest, this algorithm is the opposite of the Best fit algorithm. Figure \ref{bpwf} is an illustration of the elements packed with the Worst fit algorithm. As the figure shows, the worst fit algorithm is in fact more effective than its name might suggest.

\subsection{Almost worst fit (AWF)}
Similar to the worst fit algorithm, but the almost worst fit algorithm packs the object in the second most empty bin.  Figure \ref{bpawf} is an illustration of the elements packed with the almost worst fit algorithm.

\subsection{First fit decreasing(FFD)}
The above algorithms are very ineffective because the biggest objects might be placed at the end of the list, and thus be packed in the end, where it is more effective to first pack these large objects.
The first fit decreasing algorithms takes this into account and sorts the list before attempting to pack the items. This way the biggest items will be packed first.

\subsection{Best fit decreasing(BFD)}
Again this is the same as the best fit algorithm, but with the list being sorted before attempting to pack the objects.

\subsection{Round up}
It seems that it is more effective to sort the lists before attempting to pack objects into bins. This way bigger objects are packed first, and the smaller objects can then be fitted around the bigger objects. However in some situations it is necessary to use unsorted lists. For example in a factory with continuous production, it is never possible to have the complete list of objects, and thus never possible to sort the list.
