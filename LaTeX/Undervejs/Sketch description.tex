It shows some boxes where the user must type the dimensions of the suitcase, so the program knows how much space it has to deal with, and the measurement is the metric unit system.
When the user has typed the dimensions the program will calculate and make 3D image of the suitcase,

It has been discussed whether if there should be a 3D image or a 2D image of the suitcase where the user can see where the items shall be placed. And at the start we concluded that we should not draw the 3D image until we were sure that we could handle 3D in the program. 

In the beginning it became clear that it was not a good idea to talk about 3D images in the program because

On the sketch below we looked at how the packing list should look like, and what functions it will contain.

At last we managed how the GUI will look like. We replaced the 3D image viewer with the list of added items. We
