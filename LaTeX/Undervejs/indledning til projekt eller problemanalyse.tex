When you are going on a trip and have to stay out for one or more nights you usually need to pack some luggage. The way people pack their luggage is not always the same. Some just throw their items randomly into the suitcase, while others put it nicely into to suitcase but without a specific order.
Others again have a system regarding which order the items are put into the suitcase. If the bags are not packed in the smartest way that means that the consumer have wasted useful space and there fore not fully.
Another problem with unorganised packing is that there are no order in the bags and it might require a bigger amount of time for the consumer to find things they are looking for.
