At the start of this semester the group had a meeting and made the group contract which can be seen on appendix \fxfatal{missing appendix reference}. The group contract consists of the rules regarding the group work and the general behavior in the group. The group contract have not changed a lot since last semester. The only thing that has been changed is who have to responsibility to keep the group members serious during group work and lectures. Last semester it was the group coordinator now the whole group has the responsibility. If any of the rules in the contract is broken rule-breaker has to give the group come sort of compensation like cake or the like.
