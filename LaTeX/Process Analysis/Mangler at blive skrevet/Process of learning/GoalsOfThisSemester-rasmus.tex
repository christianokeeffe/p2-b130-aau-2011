\section{Goals of This Semester}
In this semester there has been set some goals, which are meant to be reached during the semester These goals are: 

Knowledge
	The student will after completed project-module be able to:
	\begin{itemize}
			\item Understand and account for syntax and behavior of language constructions in a concrete programming language, and how they work
	\end{itemize}

		
Skills
	The student must after a completed project-module be able to:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Implement a larger program. This includes utilizing and understanding concepts, structures and facilities in the programming language, and on this basis construct a well-structured program
		\item Complete a test of the program which, in fair extend, ensures that the developed program corresponds with the problem statement. 
	\end{itemize}

Competences
	After completion of the project-module, the student must be able to:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Delimit a problem and in this issue articulate and defend a problem, which can be solved by programming, as a main-part of the method to solve the problem.
		
		\item Develop a model, which can be applied in connection with  the solution of the selected problem. 
		\item Complete the work to a run able and demonstrable program, and hereby show skills at delimiting. 
		\item
