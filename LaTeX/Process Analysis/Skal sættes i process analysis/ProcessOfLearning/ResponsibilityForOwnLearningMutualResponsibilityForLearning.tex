\section{Responsibility for Own Learning/Mutual Responsibility for Learning}
In this group, we think that the lectures are very important. It is stated in the group contract (see Appendix \ref{chap:groupcontract}), that each member of this group must be present at all lectures. Because Aalborg University's projects are based on group work, we think that each group member has a responsibility for their own learning. If one group member has trouble understanding something in a lecture, the other group members should help that particular member understand it. So even though we have responsibility for our own learning we also have a responsibility to the group and to help those who seek help. This is important for the group to work together and help each other understand and learn.
