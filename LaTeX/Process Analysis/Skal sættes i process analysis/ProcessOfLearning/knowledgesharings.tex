\section{Knowledge Sharing}
In this project we have used subversion (SVN) to manage all report and knowledge related documents. This helped us greatly when it came to correcting the report. We had a strict cycle when writing new documents for the report. When a document was written, it was placed in a folder called "Ready to be corrected". Then another member of the group had to correct it, and place it in a second folder called "Ready to be corrected second time". Next, a third member of the group had to correct the document again, and then place it in a third folder called "Ready to be inserted in report". All documents in this last folder was considered completely done. From this folder, only the group leader were allowed to move documents into the required folder for the LaTeX to compile it correctly.

For the program code we used Microsoft Team Foundation Server to gather all the program code and administer it. This is because when writing C\# code, Microsoft Team Foundation Server provides a very good source-control inside Visual Studio. For example the Team Foundation Server was able to auto-merge most files if two files where edited simultaneously. When we corrected the final report, and also this process analysis, we each read the document at home, and then corrected everything on our projector. This also helped us to spot minor mistakes, we had missed when correcting the document at home.
