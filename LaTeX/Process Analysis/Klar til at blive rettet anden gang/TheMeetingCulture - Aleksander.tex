\section{The Meeting Culture}
We made a choice that normally we meet at 09:10 on weekdays if there is no lecture at 08:15. We then work until 16:15 in the afternoon, but we have the choice to leave after 14:00 and then use the remaining time  until 16:16 to work at home. But approximately halfway through the project it was decided, that we should stay and work until 16:15 because we were getting behind in the project schedule, and there was a tendency that less work was made at home.

The meeting culture in the group was working very well, because every member of the group where working well together and wanted to get the best out of this project. Although we were getting behind in the schedule schedule nobody had anything against the change of the meeting culture. At 9.10 there is a meeting where we tell what we have worked on the previous day, and what every member of the group is currently working on. On Fridays there is a more in-depth meeting where we look at the status of the project and how the group work together.
