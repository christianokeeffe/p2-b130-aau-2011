\section{Work Coordinating}
In the previous project there was a group coordinator that managed the time schedule and had the overview of the tasks. This has been kept in the this project. Everyone in the group could see the time schedule if they wanted to. This meant that there always where one person with the general overview, and who could hand out tasks to group members. This was to ensure that every task was made, and no one worked on the same task as another person.

Using a group coordinator worked very well in the project and we will use it for future projects to ensure that we have the same overview as we had in this project.
