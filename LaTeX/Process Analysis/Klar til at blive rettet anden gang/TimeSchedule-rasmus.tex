\section{Time Schedule}
As we know from the previous project a time schedule is a really important and handy tool to keep track of the flow of the project. It really helps with planning ahead and ensures that everything is done in time for our deadline. We are still using Microsoft Project to make the time schedule and the Gannt diagram to show the different assignments. But even with the experience we had from the previous project our time schedule was still changed along the way because some of our planning was off, and it will probably be like this for the future projects as well, because it is difficult to predict how everything will turn out.
We will still be using the same approach for our next project, because we think this works really well.
