\chapter{Conclusion}
We think that the whole project went very well. We have used the group coordinator and time schedule as magnificent tools for controlling our project, and keeping us on the right track in terms of the deadline. When the group coordinator noticed that we were behind schedule, he suspended the rule about working at home from 2 o'clock am, which turned out to help greatly on our progress. We have not been in need of the Conflict Emergency Team yet, as there have not been any conflicts in the group, but we think it is important to keep the Conflict Emergency Team if a conflict should arise. We will also keep the other roles, for example the Agenda Manager, who makes it easier to have meetings. 

This project is based on problem based learning, which means working with a society problem, and trying to develop a solution to the problem. This has helped us understand the context of the problem on a deeper level. We made a partner analysis, to help us aim our solution to the problem at specific types of people.

Every member of the group has been doing an active part of the work in this project. Throughout the project, we have gathered new knowledge on the subject of packing a suitcase. We are already experienced in working together, as we also were working together in the first semester, and yet we have developed our skills at working together as a group.
