\section{Group Contract}
At the start of this semester the group had a meeting and made the group contract which can be seen on appendix \ref{chap:grocon}. The group contract consists of the rules regarding the group work and the general behavior in the group. The group contract has been not changed a lot since last semester. The only thing that has been changed is who has the responsibility to keep the group members serious during group work and lectures. Last semester it was the group coordinator now the whole group has the responsibility. If any of the rules in the contract is broken then the rule-breaker has to give the group come sort of compensation like cake or something like that. Some of the rules the group changed were the daily working hours and some roles in the group like the group coordinator and the person responsible for making summaries of our meetings with the supervisor. 

Our opinion about the group contract is that it has worked fine. It is a good idea to have rules about for example meeting time so everybody knows what is expected of every group member. We changed a little in the working time this semester so we now meet at 9:10 when we do not have classes in the morning. Besides that has the rule about group members being allowed to leave at 14:00 been suspended in the last part of the semester. We think that our group contract is good and does not need big changes when starting on the next semester.
