\section{Work Coordinating}
like in the previous there was a group coordinator that manage the time schedule that had the overview of the tasks, but all could see the time schedule if they wanted to. this meant that there always where one person with the general overview, and could hand out tasks to group members. This was to make sure that every task were made, and no one worked on the same task as another person.

using a group coordinator was done very well in the project and we will use it for future projects to come to make sure that the same overview and control of the time as we had in this project to future.
