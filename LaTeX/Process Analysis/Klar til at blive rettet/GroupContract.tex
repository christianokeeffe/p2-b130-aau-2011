At the start of this semester the group had a meeting and made the group contract which can be seen on appendix \fxfatal{missing appendix reference}. The group contract consists of the rules regarding the group work and the general behavior in the group. The group contract have not changed a lot since last semester. The only thing that has been changed is who have to responsibility to keep the group members serious during group work and lectures. Last semester it was the group coordinator now the whole group has the responsibility. If any of the rules in the contract is broken rule-breaker has to give the group come sort of compensation like cake or the like. Some of the rules the group made was working time and who had certain special roles in the group like the group coordinator and reporter. 

Our opinion about the group contract is that it has worked fine. It is a good idea to have rules about for example meeting time so everybody know what is expected of every group member. We changed a little in the working time this semester so we now meed at 9:10 when we do not have classes in the morning. Besides that has the rule about group members being allowed to leave at 14:00 been suspended in the last part of the semester. We think that our group contract is good and does not need big changes when starting on the next semester.
