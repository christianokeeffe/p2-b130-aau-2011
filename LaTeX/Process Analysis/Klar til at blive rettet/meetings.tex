\section{Morning Meetings}
At the beginning of each work day, we would hold a short meeting, where we discussed what each member of the group was during that day. If a member was not currently working on something, the group coordinator would that member to a task. This helped the group see the progress of the project, and also ensured that no member was doing nothing at some point.

\section{Friday Meetings}
Each Friday we held a longer meeting where we had the following agenda:

\begin{enumerate}
	\item Purpose: The purpose of the meeting is explained
	\item Acceptance: Can the purpose of the meeting be accepted? 
	\item Status: How far are we in the project?
	\item Working sheet: What is going to be in the work sheet, which is sent to the supervisor? The group members in charge of the working sheet is also chosen. 
	\item Teamwork: The corporation of the group is evaluated.  
	\item What Happens Next: What should each group member work on now.
	\item Any Other Business: If a group member has something which needs to be discussed
	\item Next Meeting: The date of the next meeting is decided. 
	\item Evaluation:  The evaluation of the meeting. 
\end{enumerate}

The Friday meeting helps each group member gain an overview of the project.
