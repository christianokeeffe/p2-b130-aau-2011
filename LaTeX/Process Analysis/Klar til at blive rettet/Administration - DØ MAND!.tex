\section{Administration}
Like in our last project everyone had different roles and one of the important ones was the coordinator, who kept track of the time schedule which we made in the start of the project. The time schedule was constructed with some spare time in the end, it could be called buffer time and could be used if we were delayed. With the coordinator distributing the work that needed to be done we kept our time schedule most of the time, and as last project if there were a lot to of different assignments running at the same time, then the coordinator would elect a second in command that would share in the responsibility of keeping track of what had been done and should be done.

We really like this work form and chose to continue using it throughout this project. We still feel that it correlates very well to our skills and work form thus makes us work very efficiently.
