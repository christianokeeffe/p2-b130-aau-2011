\chapter{Introduction}
The process analysis is an analysis where we reflect over the project. The analysis describes how the group has worked during the semester. In the process analysis, it will also be described what went well and what can be changed for the next project. The process analysis will be used to find out what went well, and take this with us in the next project.
