In this report it will be documented that there is a problem with passport photos and explained why the rules of passports are needed in the modern community. These chapters will lead up to a statement of the problem which will be used in the development of a solution.
\newline
The solution will be a program based on the programming language C, so there will not be any user interface. There will be a chapter describing how the structure of the program will be, and the reason behind the construction. There will also be a section about the reflections made, when the program was being made.
\newline
One of the last chapters will concern the testing and conclusion of the finished program. What could have been done better to the program and why does it not work, if that is the case. This chapter will also concern the reflection on the product to see if it actually solves the problem or why it does not solve the problem.
\newline
The product of the project is a program which helps the user to crop and scale a passport photo as well as asking the user questions regarding the passport photo rules from the police.
