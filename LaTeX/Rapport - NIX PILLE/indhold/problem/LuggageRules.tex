Due to the volatile or dangerous nature of the items listed above they have been deemed unsafe and thus not allowed on the plane without explicit permission from the airport.

\end{itemize}

\subsection{Rules on trains}

There are different rules depending on which train company you are using. 
\newline
The Danish train company, DSB, have very few rules regarding the luggage you are allowed to bring with you. 
\newline\newline
The only rule is that your luggage need to be able to lie on the luggage rack or under the seat and not be bothering or putting any other person on the train in danger \citep{rulestrain}.
\newline\newline
Another example could be Indian Railways where the luggage is allowed to have different weight depending on which class you are on. They have no other rules regarding luggage \citep{idianrules}.

\subsection{Rules on cruise ships}
On board a cruise ship the "rules" are not really rules more like guidelines as they encourage the passengers to not exceed the limits. Furthermore the passengers luggage should be kept in their cabin during the trip\citep{Cruise}.
