After the discussion there will be a perspectivation of the project to look if some aspects of the program might be useful in the future, like how the interface is made to be user friendly and how there has been made tests on early program builds to help finding errors.

In this chapter the final product will be reflected upon whether the Targeted Features (TF) have been fulfilled and how well the specification requirements have been met (see section \ref{sec:Spec}).
